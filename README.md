## Inspiration
As many spectcular ideas are forgotten because there are no support or Investors, and Investors keep their money in pocket waiting for risky-worthy ideas. So We were thinking about bridging the gap between creative people and investors through programming. Developers are always trying to make people life richer and easier as it's our job!

## What it does
BlahajTank is an application for pitchers and sharks to share what they have in mind or pocket. So the Pictchers can look for Sharks to make their ideas for startups come true and Sharks can finally choose their risky-worthy ideas to investigate their money at. 

#### workflow
  - To sign up (register) in the application, you need to provide
      - User name
      - Email
      - Password
    
    After that, it's time to specify your category:
      - Shark
      - Pitcher
      
    according to each category, some questions will need to be answered to make sure you've chosen right category.
  - To login in your account, we need:
      - Email
      - Password
      
      Database works to reach your account if exists.
  - The Posts page contains shared posts form Pitchers with their ideas included and the more details provided from the Pitcher the better.
  - If you're a Shark and want to contact with a Pitcher, there are Chats page where they can communicate through:
      - Texting
      - Video Call

## How we built it
- We have used MERN stack (stands for MongoDB, Expressjs, React, and Nodejs) to build the app with client and server side following the MVC (Model, View, and Controller) architecture.
- To enable Video Calls chat format, we used twilio, and twilio-video API.
- The contribution went smoothly as we have used github in an effective way. 

## Challenges we ran into
- The time was basically the main challenge as we have implemented lots of pages like:
    - Sign up
    - Login in
    - Home 
    - Posts
    - Chats
    - Video Call Rooms
- Configuring how to use APIs (the terms API Key, Secret Key, and all those stuff) like twilio as it was our first time to use.
- There were tons of errors when we were trying to connect the used APIs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The Video Call chat room.
- Making the app with number of decent features despite of the time.

## What we learned
- Using twilio and twilio-video APIs.
- Working with MERN stack as some of us was their first time to know the term.
- Making Auth pages for apps. 

## What's next for BlahajTank
- We can make the video Call room has the ability to be a group chat not only peer-to-peer.
- Deployment for the app.
